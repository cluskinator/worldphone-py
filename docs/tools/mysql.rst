MySQL
============================

  The world's most popular open source database, enabling the cost-effective delivery of reliable, high-performance and scalable Web-based and embedded database applications, including all five of the top five websites.

For most projects, Cuttlesoft uses a MySQL database as the principal datastore.

  Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software.


In this project, the MySQL database is the main storage for application models.
